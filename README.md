# Breezy wind turbine monitoring App

## Quick Start
Make sure you have nodejs installed (tested with Latest LTS = 16 and v18)
`npm install` to install dependencies
`npm start` to run the development server (opens webpage on port 3000)

## Process so far
- think about best technologies to use
- pen & paper design
- create React App
- add linting
- integrate bootstrap
- add header
- add routing
- integrate axios for http reqs
- list turbines in table with simple alert icons
- add sorting (alerts at top)

## Outstanding
- integrate recharts/other library for data visualisation (trouble with later versions of node)
- improve positioning/justification of icons & widgets
- choose more appropriate icons
- rework the colour scheme
- add filtering
- add pagination
- add toast or modal or alert in cases where there are critical warnings
- refactor http requster into module
- add light/dark mode
